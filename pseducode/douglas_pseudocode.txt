DL 1st, douglas pseudocode(dino game)

import pygame, random, and os
initialize pygame and screen settings
set player to rectangle
use try and accept to attempt to import the images, if failed then set assets to basic shapes
import the sounds and set as variables
load all game assets (dino animation frames, ground, etc.)
initialize variables:

velocity_y (direction and speed up and down)
gravity (amount of force applied downward every frame)
ground_y (height of ground)
player.y (current height)
obstacles (list of all current obstacles)
speed (speed at which the character moves along the x axis)
is_ducking (boolean to keep track of current users action state)
normal_height (height of hitbox of dino when not ducking)
duck_height (height of the players hitbox when ducking)

make constant SPAWN_CACTUS_EVENT set as USEREVENT + 1
set pygame timer for spawning cacti
make constant ANIMATION_EVENT as USEREVENT + 2
make timer for ANIMATION_EVENT
make variable start_ticks that gets the amount of ticks
set clock to the time using pygame.time.Clock()
initialize running as True
initialize game_started as False
initialize first_jump_made as False
set difficulty to 0
define the function spawn_cactus_group
    if statement that adds a smaller and smaller amount to difficulty as difficulty gets higher
    set dimensions for small and large cacti
    choose randomly how many cacti to spawn based on current difficulty
    loop through the count of cacti to spawn
        randomly decide if each cactus is large or small based on difficulty
        pick a random image from the matching cactus list
        scale the image to the correct size
        place the cactus rect offscreen to the right with spacing
        add the cactus rect and image to the obstacles list
scale and set up the ground image and set two ground positions for scrolling
start outer while loop (runs forever, restarts game each death)
    if current score beats high score, update high score
    reset all variables back to starting values for new game
    display high score on screen using digit images
    reset timers and clock for new game
    start inner while loop (the actual game loop, runs while running is True)
        reset score digits and score_time to 0
        if game has started, calculate score from elapsed ticks and update difficulty
        loop through all pygame events
            if quit event, set running to False
            if spawn cactus event and game started, call spawn_cactus_group
            if space or up arrow pressed
                if player is on the ground, apply upward velocity and play jump sound
                if first jump and game not started yet, mark first_jump_made as True
            if down arrow pressed and player is on ground
                set is_ducking to True, shrink hitbox height, update dino image to duck
            if down arrow released
                set is_ducking to False, restore normal hitbox height, update dino image
            if animation event fires and game started
                alternate between run or duck animation frames depending on is_ducking
        apply velocity to player position, then apply gravity to velocity
        if player hits the ground, stop them there and reset velocity
        if first jump was made and game not started yet, officially start game and set speed
        if game started
            if score hits a multiple of 100, play point sound
            gradually increase speed up to the max speed
            scroll both ground images to the left by speed
            if either ground image scrolls fully offscreen, reset it to the right of the other
            loop through all obstacles
                move each obstacle left by speed
                if obstacle is fully offscreen left, remove it from list
                if player collides with obstacle, set running to False
        fill screen white
        draw both ground images
        convert score to 5 digit string and draw each digit using font images
        draw HI label and high score digits on screen
        draw dino using image or green rectangle depending on use_image
        draw all obstacles using their images
        update the display and tick the clock at 60fps
quit pygame
